The Resume Screening App is a sophisticated machine learning-powered tool designed to streamline the recruitment process by automatically analyzing and categorizing resumes. Built with Python and Streamlit, the application processes both PDF and text files, offering two main functionalities: resume classification and text summarization. The classification system employs TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization and a pre-trained machine learning model to categorize resumes into 25 distinct job categories, including roles like Java Developer, Data Scientist, and Business Analyst. The text summarization feature utilizes the LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis) algorithm to generate concise summaries of varying lengths (1-5 sentences) based on user preference. The app includes robust text preprocessing that cleanses the input by removing URLs, special characters, social media markers, and normalizing whitespace. It handles different text encodings (UTF-8 and Latin-1) to ensure broad compatibility. The user interface, built with Streamlit, provides an intuitive experience with simple file upload capabilities and clear result presentation. This tool is particularly valuable for HR professionals and recruiters who need to efficiently process large volumes of resumes while maintaining accuracy in candidate assessment.
